# wordpair_generator

My first Flutter App

## Getting Started

This is my first Flutter App, made following the Introduction to flutter tutorial on
[flutter.dev](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab) and
[google codelabs](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/first-flutter-app-pt2#0)

Its just a simple app that generate english word pairs (that could be used as startup
names or anything...Some were just funny). Its an infinite scrollable list of word pairs and you can
save your favorites ones too. feel free to clone and modify it as you want.

For me it is just a first step in the vast world of cross-platform developement with Flutter
